	<h3>PROCESS SUMMARY</h3>
	
	<p>
	My initial inspiration for this website's layout was that of
	your everyday magazine article. As a consequence, I made use 
	of smaller column widths to imitate their easy-to-read style. 
	I also utilised an off-white background colour to simulate 
	colour palettes shared by novel pages.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	However, during the critique process in class, one of the 
	suggestions I received was to make the website advertisement-
	themed, inspired by the central idea of my paper. At first I 
	thought of bright colours and contrasting font styles, but 
	decided against it because it would have impacted readability. 
	Eventually, I decided to create advertisements of my own, and 
	have them link to different pages on the website. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
	In addition, I deliberately made the section on pagination 
	difficult to scroll through, in as true a form I could possibly
	emulate as that of paginated tabloids and so-called "news" 
	webpages. Any frustration felt in navigating the pages was 
	intended to make visitors question the nature of online 
	advertising, and is an example of something "words alone cannot 
	provide", as mentioned in the first paragraph of my introduction 
	on the website's home page.
