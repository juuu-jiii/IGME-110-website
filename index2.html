    <p>
      I made a makeshift Mini Cooper commercial, because why not?
	  After all, I did unintentionally stumble upon 5-6 videos of 
	  the same MINI on Pexels just conveniently laid out side-by-side. 
	  Why put such a great opportunity to waste? I also tried to be 
	  as minimalistic with the design as possible, by selecting a 
	  font that was - to me, at least - simple, yet sophisticated 
	  enough to look professional.<br><br>
	  The music was also randomly selected because I thought its
	  upbeat nature fit the overall setting of the video. How it 
	  somehow manages to sync with the video in certain parts is 
	  beyond me. But hey, you know what they say: never look a gift 
	  horse in the mouth, so I shan't. I will say, however, that I'm 
	  still amused over it all.
