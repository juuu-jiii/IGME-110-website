	<h3>PAGINATION</h3>
	
	<p>
	Pagination has been on the web for ages. It is such a commonality 
	among websites on the Internet that it has caused many to believe
	that pagination is an age-old practice, that it is the "correct"
	way to format web pages <a href = "resources.html">[9]</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Contrary to popular belief, however,
	websites were not always paginated, and they certainly did not
	start out that way. Rather, a scrolling layout was adopted at
	the very outset, with paginated layouts appearing much later 
	<a href = "resources.html">[9]</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Pagination, as an implementation, has been quite controversial among
	fans of the Internet. As you probably can imagine, it has its benefits,
	but those do not come without a hefty price tag attached to them. With
	that being said, I have created lists of said benefits and drawbacks.
