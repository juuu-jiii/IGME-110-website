	<h3>HOW HAVE ADVERTISEMENTS AFFECTED MEDIA TODAY?</h3>
	<h5>SZUN KIDD CHOI, ROCHESTER INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY</h5>
	<p>As an extension to my research paper, I have put together this
	website to show the effects advertisements have had on the media we
	consume on a daily basis, in ways words alone cannot provide.</p>
	
	<p>All in
	all, my goal here is not to persuade you, dear visitor, about
	what I make of these effects it is merely to document the severity
	of what I believe to be a predicament. In the end, it is ultimately
	up to you to form your own conclusions regarding such matters, and
	to decide whether reformation is needed sometime in the near future.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Use the navigation bar on the left to select a topic, or be a little
	adventurous with the various advertisements made available for your 
	personal consumption. The choice is yours. </p>
